        </h2>
        <p>Welcome to this learning module on the new Strep A testing service available to customers. The service allows
            a trained pharmacist to assess a customer presenting with sore throat to determine if they are suffering
            from a streptococcal throat infection. Following a swab test, if the customer shows
            a positive result for the presence of Strep A, the trained pharmacist can supply antibiotics for the
            treatment of the infection, if appropriate, via an in-store Patient Group Direction (PGD).

        <h2>Sore throat and Strep A</h2>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Sore throat is a common condition which can be due to a viral or bacterial cause. Both are normally a
            self-limiting and generally resolve within two weeks.* An example of a bacterial cause of sore throat is
            streptococcal infection.
        </strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Streptococcal bacteria are highly contagious. They can spread through airborne droplets when someone with the
            infection coughs or sneezes, or through droplets on hard surfaces such as door handles, toys or cups.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Group A streptococcus infections (known as Strep A) are characterised by pain at the back of the throat which
            feels worse when swallowing, along with redness in the throat and possibly puss on the tonsils along with a
            fever of over 38.5°C. Children may also have a rash. Although Strep A is not considered dangerous, it can
            lead to complications including scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and inflammation of the kidneys.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Always keep the above in mind when speaking to customers about their symptoms so you can provide the
            appropriate advice.</p>
