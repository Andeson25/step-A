		<h2>Step A testing service

			<span>- a new initiative</span>
		</h2>
		<p>Welcome to this learning module on the new Strep A testing service available to customers. The service allows
			a trained pharmacist to assess a customer presenting with sore throat to determine if they are suffering
			from a streptococcal throat infection. Following a swab test, if the customer shows
			a positive result for the presence of Strep A, the trained pharmacist can supply antibiotics for the
			treatment of the infection, if appropriate, via an in-store Patient Group Direction (PGD).

		<h2>Sore throat and Strep A</h2>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Sore throat is a common condition which can be due to a viral or bacterial cause. Both are normally a
			self-limiting and generally resolve within two weeks.* An example of a bacterial cause of sore throat is
			streptococcal infection.
		</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p>Streptococcal bacteria are highly contagious. They can spread through airborne droplets when someone with the
			infection coughs or sneezes, or through droplets on hard surfaces such as door handles, toys or cups.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Group A streptococcus infections (known as Strep A) are characterised by pain at the back of the throat which
			feels worse when swallowing, along with redness in the throat and possibly puss on the tonsils along with a
			fever of over 38.5°C. Children may also have a rash. Although Strep A is not considered dangerous, it can
			lead to complications including scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and inflammation of the kidneys.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Always keep the above in mind when speaking to customers about their symptoms so you can provide the
			appropriate advice.</p>

				<span>Role of the Healthcare Partner</span>

			<p>Although a pharmacist needs to assess the customer to determine whether they have a Strep A infection,
				the Healthcare Partner’s role is vital in speaking to customers about the service. Customers may not
				come into the pharmacy actively seeking advice on the service; they are more likely to come in asking
				for advice on their symptoms. Below are ways in which you could build a good rapport with customers and
				promote the service:</p>

			<h2>Steps to delivering a great consultation</h2>
			<p>If you have a customer who wants to determine whether or not they have a bacterial infection, it is
				important
				for you to provide detailed information on the service before undertaking the consultation. This will
				help
				put them at ease and understand what to expect from the test.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Before undertaking the swab test, you will need to ensure that they are eligible for the service. There
				are
				several instances where supply of antibiotics under the PGD will not be suitable. You can <strong><a
						href="#">download the exclusion criteria here</a></strong> for further information. Familiarise
				yourself with this and check the criteria with customers before undertaking the service.
			</p>
			<h3>To be able to deliver a successful consultation, make sure you:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Are fully familiar with the PGD</li>
				<li>Have all your equipment ready</li>
				<li>Go through the FeverPain criteria</li>
				<li>Carefully undertake the swab test</li>
