		<p>Welcome to this learning module on the new Strep A testing service available to customers. The service allows
			a trained pharmacist to assess a customer presenting with sore throat to determine if they are suffering
			from a streptococcal throat infection. Following a swab test, if the customer shows
			a positive result for the presence of Strep A, the trained pharmacist can supply antibiotics for the
			treatment of the infection, if appropriate, via an in-store Patient Group Direction (PGD).

		<h2>Sore throat and Strep A</h2>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Sore throat is a common condition which can be due to a viral or bacterial cause. Both are normally a
			self-limiting and generally resolve within two weeks.* An example of a bacterial cause of sore throat is
			streptococcal infection.
		</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p>Streptococcal bacteria are highly contagious. They can spread through airborne droplets when someone with the
			infection coughs or sneezes, or through droplets on hard surfaces such as door handles, toys or cups.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Group A streptococcus infections (known as Strep A) are characterised by pain at the back of the throat which
			feels worse when swallowing, along with redness in the throat and possibly puss on the tonsils along with a
			fever of over 38.5°C. Children may also have a rash. Although Strep A is not considered dangerous, it can
			lead to complications including scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and inflammation of the kidneys.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Always keep the above in mind when speaking to customers about their symptoms so you can provide the
			appropriate advice.</p>

				for advice on their symptoms. Below are ways in which you could build a good rapport with customers and

		<h2>The FeverPAIN score</h2>
		<p>The FeverPAIN criteria is a clinical scoring tool that can help to identify if a customer’s sore throat is
			likely to be as a result of a Strep A infection. The criteria is as follows:</p>
		<div class="feather-info-block">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span><strong>Fever</strong> during previous 24 hours</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span><strong>P</strong>urulence (pus on tonsils)</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span><strong>A</strong>ttend rapidly (within 3 days after onset of symptoms)</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Severely <strong>I</strong>nflamed tonsils</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span><strong>N</strong>o cough or coryza (inflammation of mucus membranes in the nose)</span>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Each of the FeverPAIN criteria scores 1 point (maximum score of 5). A score of 4 or 5 is thought to be
			associated with a 62-65% likelihood of isolating streptococcus and would deem the customer eligible for the
			service. You can now undertake the swab test.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>If the customer doesn't meet the criteria, you could recommend an OTC product (if appropriate) or refer them
			to their GP if they are worried about their symptoms.</p>
		<br>
		<p>You should also take the customers pulse – anyone with a pulse of over 100 needs to see a doctor immediately
			or be referred to A&E.</p>
